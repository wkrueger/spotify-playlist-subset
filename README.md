# Spotify playlist subset

[spotify-playlist-subset.now.sh](https://spotify-playlist-subset.now.sh)

Creates a new playlist with a random selection of N songs from another playlist (or the "liked songs").

I use this to create smaller playlists that I can download to my phone for trips or casual usage.

I have created this as fast as possible, so there is no styling. The app is written using next.js and deployed on vercel. It is 100% client-side.
